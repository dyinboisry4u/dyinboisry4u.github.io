At homeostatic/normal intestinal tissue they do not contribute cell turnover but can repopulate the crypt upon damage. 2. progenitor cells: also named as transit-amplifying cells(TACs) (not accurate) | more specific than stem cells and can only be pushed to differentiate into its ‚Äútarget‚Äù cell type. intestinal stem cell niche (microenvironment) Adult stem cells usually reside in a specialized niche microenvironment (niche cells and the niche signals they produce), which provides necessary extracellular signals and substances to promote the long-term maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells The epithelium and mesenchyme cooperate to generate the complex dynamic observed in intestinal crypts. Together they provide the key signals that regulate intestinal fate determination: WNT, Notch, EGF and BMP signalling (mesenchymal) niche 3. epithelium cell: epithelium cell (especially Paneth cell) constitute the epithelial niche Ref: 2022, Cell Mol Gastroenterol Hepatol 2017, Nature epithelium cell i.

NOTE: for CRC IMC, here is a review:2017, Gastroenterology subtypes: Warning Here is an unclear part, most people think mesenchymal cell represent a non-hematopoietic, non-epithelial, and non-endothelial stromal compartments of connective tissues.
