# (230215-bioRxiv) A Single-cell Perturbation Landscape of Colonic Stem Cell Polarisation - P1

Cancer cells are regulated by oncogenic mutations and microenvironmental signals, yet these processes are often studied separatelyðŸ˜•. To functionally map how **cell-intrinsic** and **cell-extrinsic** cues co-regulate cell-fate in colorectal cancer (CRC), we performed a systematic single-cell analysis of 1,071 colonic organoid cultures regulated by...

1. **Intestinal stem cell (ISC):** 
* i. `Crypt base columnar (CBC) cells`: canonical/traditional/rapidly-cycling stem cell **|** generation of multiple lineages and long-term self-renewal **|** bottom of the crypt; interspersed between Paneth cells **|** LGR5+ OLFM4+ 
* ii. `+4 cells/Label-retaining cells (LRC)`: reserved/precursor/quiescent stem cell population [2013, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11965) **|** +4 means located at the ~+4 from the crypt base;label-retaining means take advantage of these cells slow-cycling characteristic to take LRC approach (e.g. EdU labeling), a lineage tracing method, and LRCs are cells that retain a DNA synthesis label after a prolonged chase period **|** committed to mature into Paneth cells and EECs, but retain the ability to reacquire stem-cell function. At homeostatic/normal intestinal tissue they do not contribute cell turnover but can repopulate the crypt upon damage.
2. **progenitor cells:**
also named as transit-amplifying cells(TACs) (not accurate) **|** more specific than stem cells and can only be pushed to differentiate into its "target" cell type.

<b><center><font color=#5D9C59>intestinal stem cell niche (microenvironment)</font></center></b>

> Adult stem cells usually reside in a specialized niche microenvironment (niche cells and the niche signals they produce), which provides necessary extracellular signals and substances to promote the long-term maintenance and self-renewal of stem cells 

> The epithelium and mesenchyme cooperate to generate the complex dynamic observed in intestinal crypts. Together they provide the key signals that regulate intestinal fate determination: `WNT`, `Notch`, `EGF` and `BMP` signalling

3. **epithelium cell:**
epithelium cell (especially Paneth cell) constitute the epithelial niche
* i. Secretory lineage
  * (1) Paneth cells: 
  * (2) Goblet cells
  * (3) Enteroendocrine cells
  * (4) Tuft cells
* ii. Absorptive lineage
  * (1) Enterocytes
  * (2) M cells

here is epithelium cell specification: <br>

4. **Intestinal mesenchymal (stromal) cell (IMC):**
1) Naming ambiguity: mesenchymal cell (MC) or stromal cell **|** mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cellðŸ˜¤ <br>
2) cancer-associated transdifferentiation: transdifferentiation of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells (**EMT**); transdifferentiation of endothelial to mesenchymal cells (**EndMT**); transdifferentiation of mesothelial cells to mesenchymal cells (**MMT**) <br>
3) Most of IMC originates from the mesoderm and differentiates from mesenchymal stem cells, locate on subepithelial compartment, constitute the mesenchymal niche.<br>
`NOTE:` for CRC IMC, here is a review:[2017, Gastroenterology](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28111227/)<br>
4) subtypes: pericyte; myofibroblasts; fibroblast...; (Foxl1+ MCs; Gli1+ MCs...) <br>

5. **Other cell types:**
i. Immune cells: ..<br>
ii. Endothelial cells: <br>
iii. Mesothelial cells: some papers seem classify mesothelial cells as mesenchymal (stromal) cell..?ðŸ˜¤ <br>
iv. intestinal neural cells: intestinal has its typical nervous system called intrinsic enteric nervous system (ENS): neuron and enteric glial cells (EGC)... <br>
