{{< admonition type=tip title="Brief" open=true >}}
Here we describe a functional single-cell study exploring **how cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic cues 
co-regulate colonic epithelial fate**.

1. **Intestinal stem cell (ISC):** 
* i. `Crypt base columnar (CBC) cells`: canonical/traditional/rapidly-cycling stem cell **|** generation of multiple lineages and long-term self-renewal **|** bottom of the crypt; interspersed between Paneth cells **|** LGR5+ OLFM4+ 
* ii. `+4 cells/Label-retaining cells (LRC)`: reserved/precursor/quiescent stem cell population [2013, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11965) **|** +4 means located at the ~+4 from the crypt base;label-retaining means take advantage of these cells slow-cycling characteristic to take LRC approach (e.g. EdU labeling), a lineage tracing method, and LRCs are cells that retain a DNA synthesis label after a prolonged chase period **|** committed to mature into Paneth cells and EECs, but retain the ability to reacquire stem-cell function. At homeostatic/normal intestinal tissue they do not contribute cell turnover but can repopulate the crypt upon damage.
2. **progenitor cells:**
also named as transit-amplifying cells(TACs) (not accurate) **|** more specific than stem cells and can only be pushed to differentiate into its "target" cell type.
2. **epithelium cell:**
* i.
