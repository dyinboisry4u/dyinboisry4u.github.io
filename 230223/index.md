# iTerm2 Shell Integration


# iTerm2 shell integration
> iTerm2 may be integrated with the unix shell so that it can keep track of your **command history, current working directory, host name, and moreâ€”even over ssh**. This enables several useful features.

## Install
---
NOTE: first ssh your server <br>
1. Select the `iTerm2>Install Shell Integration` menu item
2. Select `Continue` and select the second install way `Internet-free Install`
3. Select `Continue` until install finished

## Features
---
iTerm2 Documentation:
[**Documentation**](https://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) </br>

For me, 2 features are very useful:</br>
1. `imgcat`: display one or more images inline </br>
2. Download and Upload: </br>
i. You can **right-click on a filename** (e.g., in the output of ls) and select Download with scp from hostname**, and iTerm2 will download the file for you. </br>
ii. If you drop a file (e.g., from Finder) into iTerm2 while holding the **option** key, iTerm2 will offer to upload the file via scp to the remote host into the directory you were in on the line you dropped the file on.
